# Exciting Journey Ahead: My Blog Launches in Two Weeks!

Hello, everyone!

I'm thrilled to announce that in just two weeks, I'll be launching my very own blog! This blog will be a space where I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on react native development.

First Post Date: 18.12.23

In anticipation of this exciting journey, I want to give you a sneak peek into what you can expect in the upcoming months. Hereâ€™s a tentative list of content I plan to cover:

Security and Authorization in React Native Apps - A deep dive into authorization and how to handle credentials data or environment variables.
React Native Testing Strategies - Essential Insights into Unit, Integration, and End-to-End Testing.
Constructive Review: Proper Feedback for Pull Requests - Exploring best practices in code review and collaboration.
And this is just the beginning! I'm looking forward to growing with you all and exploring software development together.

Stay tuned for more updates, and mark your calendars for the launch! If you have any suggestions or topics you'd love to see covered, feel free to drop a comment below or contact me at dawidwyrkowski@gmail.com.

Can't wait to embark on this journey with you!

Best regards,
Dawid Wyrkowski
